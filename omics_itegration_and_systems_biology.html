## Background and rationale 

 - **Omics Integration**
 
  - **What is Omics data Integration:** Ask 5 different people, get 5 different answers
  
  - May refer to study of **commonalities and differences** between two or more omics data sets
  
  - May refer to **variation explained beyond single omics**
  
  - May refer to **knowledge integration** to strengthen evidence obtained on a single or multiple omics 
  
 - **Systems Biology**
 
  - What is Systems Biology: *Ask 5 different people, get 10 different answers*
  
  - May refer to study biological processes at a holistic level, not always omics or high throughput
  
  - A system may comprise of a cell, a tissue, an organism or an ecosystem
  
  - Systems maybe static or dynamic
  
  - Involves combination *In Silico* and *In-vitro* experiments.
  
---


## Why Data integration? 


 - Biological processes do not work alone in isolation
 
 - Model and Address heterogeneity across data sets 
 
 

---

## Omics measurements

 - **Omics measurements are fundamentally different due to technical reasons**
  - Sequencing techniques vs. mass spectrometry based technologies have different   
  dynamic range and measurement space. 
  - Itnesities do not always correspond to actual amount in the sample. This makes global normalization tricky.
  - Same samples measure after a period of time does not correspond to same values. 
   

 - **Different Omics measure fundamentally different aspects of biology**
 
  - A classic example is *Phosphoproteomics* where proteins are present in very small amounts but just addition of modification leads to activity.
  
  - Obviously measuring omics in blood vs. tissue have different interpretations 

 - **Some times (in fact most of the time) it is best to statistically analyse omics data with respective pipelines and then try to Integrate them.**
  - Add followup *look ups* or statistical test for association/correlations. **Meta Analyses**
  - Rather rely on visualizations that communicate with the audience you are interested in.
  
 - **Avoid strict cut-offs and binning of the data just based on p-values when comparing different Omics**

---


## Omics Data Integration

 - **Under developed and continuously filed in bioinformatics**  
 
 - Combine data, find shared and distinct information information.  
 
 - We learn tools and ways of working with different types of data (Venn diagram's anyone?)  
 
 - Interpretation and application depends on the study questions  
 - More data -&gt; More tools -&gt; More complexity (Redundancy, contradictions)  
 - Needs across disciplinary communication  
 
 - Clever visualizations lead to impact, **poor visualizations = less impact**, No visualization = Hardly any impact. Big impact papers these crap a lot of data into complex figures. 
  
 - Many tools and approaches, guideline only for specific purposes. ***More Responsibility on the analyst to document analyses  pipelines.***

## Omics Integration Techniques: Data Driven

 - **Unsupervised analysis:** no known sample groups and is exploratory
 
  - Principal Component Analysis [(PCA)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0308-303) for dimensionality reduction
  - Projection to Latent Structures (PLS) to model multiple phenotypes
  - Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to find linear combinations of maximum correlations

 - **Supervised analysis:** Class membership to discriminate sample groups and perform  prediction 
  - PLS Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), 
  - Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker discovery using a Latent cOmponents  **[DIABLO](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/067611v2)** 
  - MINT (F Rohart et al. 2017).

- The study aims to find predictive markers for Immunotherapy response

- Measured ~6000 proteins (TMT) in ~200 samples 

- RNA-Seq ~ 20 000 genes in 66 samples

]

## Steps in data Integration

- Transform protein ratio data to intensities

- Remove Batch effects in the data

- Transform count RNA-seq data (voom)

- Scale the data

- Extract overlapping samples from omics

- Identify explained variance and optimal number of PCs

- Identify number of features fro each PC and each data set

- Model important discriminating features

## What are Genome scale metabolic models (GEMs)

.pull-left-50[
- Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) are mathematical reconstructions of the metabolic networks with all known metabolic reactions

- In some cases, GEMs could represent the whole tissue or body of a multicellular organism.

- In these metabolic networks, the gene-protein-reaction (GPR) relationships are annotated. 

- All the reactions in GEMs are mass-balanced, ensuring stoichiometric balance.

## Fundamentals of Genome Scale Metabolic Modelling


**Metabolic reconstruction:**

A carefully curated and biochemically validated knowledge base in which all known chemical reactions for an organism are detailed and cataloged.

**Genome-scale model**
A condition-specific, mathematically described, commutable derivative of a metabolic reconstruction, containing comprehensive knowledge of metabolism.

**Solution space:**
The feasible region satisfying a set of constraints. In constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) models, this represents the feasible flux values for all of the reactions in the model.

**Flux distributions**

A set of steady-state fluxes for all of the reactions in a metabolic network.

## Why GEMs in Omics integration

- (GEMs): a valuable systems biology platforms for 
  - Model-guided data analysis of large omics datasets
  - Provide cellular context to the data 
  - Allow the integration of diverse omics data 
  - Directly link metabolites to enzymes.

  - Elucidate how changes in one component affect other pathways and cell phenotype 
  - Growth, cell energetic 
  - Pathway ﬂuxes 
  - Biosynthesis of cell components, byproduct secretion, etc.
  - These systems biology models can provide a mechanistic link from **genotype to phenotype**

## Considerations

* Pay attention to gene IDs
* Bias in gene sets
* Confusing gene set names
* Consider gene set size
* Adjust for multiple testing
* Large number of highly overlapping gene-sets (representing a similar biological theme) can bias interpretation and take attention from other biological themes that are represented by fewer gene-sets

_Notes_.
Figure 1.  Overview of the refined GSA workflow. ( A ) The key steps in the workflow. Starting from user-defined gene-level statistics, and their possible modifications, gene set statistics are calculated according to the 11 available methods. Significance of the gene sets is estimated based on a theoretical null distribution or a permutation approach. The final gene set P -values will be separated into the defined directionality classes, facilitating the interpretation step. ( B ) A graph representation of our GSA workflow. Each path through the graph corresponds to a unique run of the GSA. The nodes represent the number of settings that can be made at each step. The resulting directionality classes depend on the combination of settings made. ( C ) Not all paths, or combinations of settings, are allowed. The table shows which settings are possible for each gene set statistic method. The highlighted settings correspond to the highlighted path in B and will result in two of the three possible P -value classes
